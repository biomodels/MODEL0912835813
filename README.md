# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mechanistic model of ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion.**   
Dempsher DP, Gann DS, Phair RD. _Am J Physiol_ 1984 Apr;246(4 Pt 2):R587-96
[6326602](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6326602) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Adrenal secretory rates of cortisol and arterial concentrations of
adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) were measured in conscious trained dogs subjected
to intravenous infusion of ACTH. To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to
the secretion of cortisol, a mechanistic mathematical model based on current
hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely
believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine
3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which provides substrate cholesterol by
activating cholesterol ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of
cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, cholesterol
modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl
(HMG)-CoA reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the
biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations
subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of
intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the
known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this model,
steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its
receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport. The
transient response is dominated by a depletable pool of intracellular free
cholesterol. Other inferences based on the model are presented, and a
quantifiable cellular basis for increased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is
proposed.
